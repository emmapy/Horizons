Horizons is an homage to my favorite mobile game, Blendoku by Lonely Few

Screenshots of gameplay can be found on my portfolio here, https://www.iampalmer.com/works/horizons
The web version is available to play here, https://emmapy.s3.amazonaws.com/blend/web+builds/Horizons_web/index.html

To play, arrange the library of color tiles into intersecting gradients.
